**About myself:** I am a 5th year CS Ph.D. student with Prof. Bradley Hayes at CU Boulder. I am interested in Robotics, Accessibility, and Human Robotics Interaction (HRI) and unifying them to create real-world Assistive Technology. My thesis involves developing robotic systems that can assist people with visual impairments in performing daily tasks more independently by providing long-term and fine-grain guidance.

**Other interests:** I enjoy playing tennis a lot (like a lot!!). On good sunny days, I also like to bike and run in the lovely city of Boulder.

**Minor-flex** - I have more than 51 millions views on my Google Map [contributions](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118433183916755884441/photos/) and have received a rather vibrant pair of socks from Google. And no, that was all I ever got from them.

**Research Abstract:** Recent advances in machine learning, computer vision, sensors, and computing have opened up opportunities to develop practical assistive technologies for real-world applications. However, these technologies have traditionally underutilized key algorithms and techniques from robotics. Concepts from robotics, such as persistent mapping, long-horizon planning, sequential decision-making, are essential for building effective assistive autonomy. My research explores some of these use cases and demonstrate how robotics principles can transform assistive technology into a tool for long-term guidance and independence.
