**About myself:** I am a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, conducting research on using diffusion models to generate efficient multi-agent warehouse layouts that improve throughput. I’m affiliated with the [CAIRO](https://cairo-lab.com/lab.html) and [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/) labs, where I strive to apply neural networks to solve real-world problems.

Originally from an Aerospace Engineering background—which I still enjoy teaching when I can—I pivoted into Machine Learning a few years ago and eventually made it my full-time focus. My industry experience includes working as a Data Scientist at Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce company.

Beyond academics, I love running around Boulder’s scenic trails, dancing, playing the guitar, and hitting the gym. My goal is to combine cutting-edge AI techniques with practical applications to make a meaningful impact in both research and industry.
