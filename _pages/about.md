I am a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

Originally from an Aerospace Engineering background—which I still enjoy teaching when I can—I pivoted into Machine Learning a few years ago and eventually made it my full-time focus. I have industry experience working as a Data Scientist at Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce company. 

Currently, I am conducting research on using diffusion models to generate efficient multi-agent warehouse layouts that improve throughput, and I’m affiliated with the [CAIRO](https://cairo-lab.com/lab.html) and [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/) labs, where I strive to apply neural networks to solve real-world problems. 

Beyond academics, I love running around Boulder’s scenic trails (I highly recommend running the Boulderthon—I ran the 10K myself!), dancing, playing the guitar, and hitting the gym.
