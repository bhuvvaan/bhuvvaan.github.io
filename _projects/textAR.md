## Overview

We developed a proof-of-concept augmented reality ARKit app that can parse text in the wild and visually represent it for the ease of reading. We also built a basic text editor on top of it designed again around ease of reading. [[Github Link]](https://github.com/ShivendraAgrawal/EduAR)

## Preparing ARKit

**Spatial Mapping:**
First, spatially map the surrounding environment. The yellow dots represent feature points indicating that ARKit is perceiving and mapping the environment.

## Parsing and Visualizing Text in a Scene

**Text Recognition and Visualization:**
EduAR utilizes the LSTM mode of Tesseract OCR to read text from paper. It visualizes this by displaying 3D text on a floating plane in AR, anchored to the real-world text location.

      </div>

## Visual Aide Text Editor

**Interactive Text Editing:**
The Visual Aide Text Editor allows learners to generate visually anchored 3D text for all texts in a scene. Users can tap desired text segments to input visual aids.

**Text Editor Features**

- **Standard Options:** Copy, share, and define text.
- **Unique Read Mode:** Focus on one paragraph, sentence, or word at a time, with swipe navigation.
- **Real-Time Font Size Adjustment:** Modify font size on-the-fly for convenience.

      <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="vertical-align:middle">

      </div>
  </div>

## 3D Objects Integration

**Enhancing Visual Learning:**

- **Double Tap to Visualize:** Users can double-tap anywhere on the screen to spawn a 3D object on a detected plane.
- **Object Interaction:** The spawned 3D objects can be rotated and resized using pinch gestures (movement is restricted).
- **Object Database:** Objects are selected from a predefined database and are contextually linked to the scanned text, aiding visual learners in grasping concepts better.

          {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog/arkit/GIF4.gif" title="3D Objects" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
      </div>
  </div>
